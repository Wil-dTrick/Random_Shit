# Purpose 

Share some quick, formula-based tips to de-escalate a situation. Some steps may feel unnatural or uncomfortable for you as the person trying to control the situation. That's just how it goes. It gets better with practice.

The acknowledgement framework provided here is often overkill but using it can help you make sure you're not missing anything. This framework seeks to resolve the conflict without being authoritative. This works in almost all situations. 

It's beyond the scope of this document to address physical altercations. If a fight breaks out, the overwhelming majority of people need to stay out of it and keep others from jumping in. Creating additional injured people doesn't help. It's the same logic as not reaching into a dog fight. 

The goal isn't usually to make everyone friends or everyone happy. That may not be possible. The goal is to bring the temperature of the conversation down. 

Note: Most people don't use this framework forever. People develop their own styles over time and this framework becomes a fallback for if they encounter a new situation that requires a new approach. 

# Requirements 

Not taking the escalation personally, Listening to the literal words the escalated person is saying. 

# Important Concepts

* Acknowledgement - a tailored version of a canned response that helps the escalated person feel heard.

* Stakes - What the escalated person feels is 'on the line.' 

* Face - the public image people want to present within a given social framework

* Mirroring - A series of natural human behaviors/instincts that all ultimately involve one person copying another person in a social situation. The copying invokes feelings of a comfortable social interaction. The acknowledgement simulates you mirroring them. If you do it right, the person will start to mirror you. 

# TL;DR:

* Stay Calm
* Listen
* Say something about the emotion they're feeling and repeat their concern back at them.
* Set Boundaries
* Be aware of your body language and perceptions about you
* Get them involved in solution-making.

# Getting Started

## Stay Calm 

Whatever is happening isn't about you. But if you inappropriately meet them where they are at, you can become the focus of the escalated behavior in ways you don't want. Note: Some people will use meeting people where they're at as a tool to bring them back down. I do this but I meet them at their escalated level while pursuing the same goals of this de-escalation framework.

Tips to stay calm

* Remember that whatever caused this behavior is probably one of many things happening in the person's life. The current moment/issue probably isn't all that important to them. 

* Remember that at the end of this you get to go do something else. You'll go home and forget this conversation soon enough. 

* If you are the sort who likes a challenge, take it as a challenge to resolve the situation. I usually have a goal of getting the escalated person to apologize on their own, laugh at something I said, or thank me. I can usually accomplish one of these things.

* Be honest about outcomes. If you know early on that you cannot resolve the situation to the person's satisfaction... tell them that. This keeps expectations reasonable. 'I hear what you're saying. I don't think we can get the exact outcome you want but we can talk about this and do our best.' Ending with something like that prompts the person to consider the final outcome, whatever it is, the best outcome that was available. You tie the outcome to the concept of 'best' ahead of time. -- additionally, it can reduce pressure on you to get a specific outcome. I have straight up told a bunch of people that there isn't a solution that will make everyone happy. Like it's just not possible. 


## Redirect

Sometimes it easier if the escalated situation is directed at you. Getting in between two people can be difficult. If one person is relatively calm and the other is not. You can focus on how you failed the situation to bring the heat onto yourself, which you can then defuse much easier. 

## Body Language 

Your goal is to be non-threatening. If you can make yourself as neutral as furniture, it's going to make life easier. 

Don't face them directly when they're tense. Stand at a slight angle to them with a neutral posture. I usually stand with my left shoulder closer to them than my right. I've found this disarms people because most people are right handed so I'm putting my 'weak' side close to their 'strong' side. Alternatively, put a table or something else between you. Nothing so tall that they can't see your hands. 

Once you've connected with them, you can turn to face them more directly if that's more comfortable for you.

Eye contact is very useful. It makes people feel more vulnerable and can make them feel seen.

## Manage Perception

If the conflict you're walking into is between someone you know and someone you don't, be cognizant that the person you don't know will perceive a bias. A quick way to work around this is to tell the person you know to shut up and let the person you don't know explain their side first. You're going to have to trust you can explain your reasoning later to the person you already know. Giving the appearance you're taking their side can make them want to work with you and forget the other person. If you can dismiss the person you know from the conversation, you might just be able to get right back to business. 

Another aspect of managing perception is knowing how you look to other people. Tall and masculine people are going to come across as more threatening. Sitting down or leaning on something, if possible, can help break that up. The person can't listen effectively if they're both escalated and looking for threatening behavior. Doing something with your hands can also help. Even if it's kinda pointless busy work. 

Some threats may not be obvious to you, but are obvious to others. White women have historically been a threat to black men, as an example. A white woman threatening to call the police on a black man is a threat of violence because of the history involved with that dynamic. 

## Acknowledgements

Acknowledgements are a formula-based phrase that escalated people tend to respond to. It has four goals:

   * Demonstrate that you are listening 

   * Display your understanding of the cause of the conflict.

   * Create a goal-based conversation 

   * Bring you and the escalated person into the same team. The relationship you want to form is one where they view you as working with them.

You don't need to be smiling or even sound pleasant when you do this. Whatever is natural for you is going to be best- this can take some experimentation. I go with a 'Hey, I get it' attitude most the time. 

A simple acknowledgement might look like:

``` I understand you're (emotion) about (problem more-or-less exactly as they stated it). I would be (emotion) in your shoes. Let's (solution-based phrase that includes you and the other person on the same team). (optional question to move the discussion forward or to take the suggested action.) ```

So if someone is upset about being cut in line, and the line is moving quickly you might use:

``` Hey. I get it. You're upset that people are cutting in line. I know I feel disrespected when I'm following the rules and others aren't. How about for today we get you through the line and then we can talk about how we might do this better next time. Is that okay? ```

Even if you just try to remember the ones about being angry, they can be useful to drill down into the issue.

Note that your statements about how you might feel in their shoes don't have to be true. Lying is an option. That step is used to change the conversation from a 'me versus you' to a 'us together' one. Anger that a person can't direct tends to fizzle out.

The part of the acknowledgement that is the solution should attempt to address what the person feels the stakes are.

## Set Boundaries 

If you're going to lay down some rules, the time to do it is right after you get yourselves on the same side. They should be presented as expectations that apply to both of you (all parties) and not rules the other person should follow. 

## Ask permission 

The acknowledgement above asked 'Is that okay?' This gives the illusion of control to the angry party. How they answer is irrelevant. If they say yes, you can start with that course of action. If they say no, you can counter with something like 'Our goal is to fill your basket up and then try to avoid this problem in the future. How would you like to do those two things?'

## Get them involved in the solution 

Let them make suggestions on how to fix the problem in the future. Emphasize that what happened happened and we can change that. Even if their solutions are trash, listen to them and present their idea back at them as something you'll look into. 

## De-escalation Hold

This can be a little harder to pull off in person.

Sometimes the person needs a minute. If you think that a brief distraction will help, create one. On the phones at work this literally was putting them on hold for two minutes while you 'Look up that policy just to be sure or see if there's anything else we can do.' 

The goal should be to give them a non-negotiable minute. Like a minute they have to take where the conversation isn't about what's happening. 

You can offer them something. This one's the easiest. 'I need a drink do you want a water?' 'Can we sit while we talk? Over here maybe. Thanks, it's so hot out.' (This doubles as asking them to do you a favor)

You can also ask them to do you a small favor. You can set this up sometimes. If you have a water bottle, set it down close to them. Settle yourself in a little bit away after a minute. If you think they need a minute, ask them to hand you your water. If you have water to share, offer them some right after they hand you yours. Now you're quite literally having a drink with them. 

If you can indicate you have other things you need to be doing right now, you can use that. 'Hey, I need to do this thing. I want to make sure we get you taken care of, can you walk with me while I do that and we can keep talking?' 

The last two work on a lot of people because when someone does you a favor, even a small one, they feel like they've invested in you. You're now an investment however small that is. If you include them in something you're doing, you can sometimes push that 'we're on a team' feeling.

## If it's not working

If you're not getting the result you want, bring someone else in. Sometimes it's not the message, it's the messenger. That's not a reflection on you, it probably has nothing to do with you, specifically. You're just not resonating with them and that's okay. If you are working with a group, it can help to establish someone as 'the supervisor.' 

Or have an understanding that tagging someone into an argument puts them in the 'supervisor' role. This gets into role play a bit. But if you're not getting through, you can say 'I hear you. Let me get so-and-so. They usually handle these and they have the best ideas.' OR 'Let me get so-and-so. Last time this came up they were able to help.' Or if it's a really heated situation 'Let me get the supervisor, (whoever)' and then yell for them. Getting a new person can also function as a de-escalation hold. By the time they get there the person may have backed down a bit. 

Just don't surprise someone with suddenly being the 'supervisor.' It can help to prompt whoever you're bringing in by introducing them as the supervisor or having some experience or authority. If this tactic is used, it's important than the supervisor be perceived as having authority over the person that called them in, not necessarily over the person that needs de-escalated. The same tactics should still be used. 

# Afterward

After de-escalation, there's always an opportunity for things to escalate again. Sometimes that's due to the person feeling they've lost face or being embarrassed about their behavior. Some people are just in a volatile mindset. That usually goes back to unmet needs. If you've successfully gotten them to think of you as being on their team, you can revisit that temporary relationship to bring the situation back down to a calmer place. 

Today's situation wasn't helped by the communication barriers that existed, which are no one's fault. I think both women had the same concern- Both were concerned with different aspects of fairness.
