#Purpose 

Share some quick, formula-based tips to de-escalate a situation. Some steps may feel unnatural or uncomfortable for you as the person trying to control the situation. That's just how it goes. 

It's beyond the scope of this document to address physical altercations. If a fight breaks out, the overwhelming majority of people need to stay out of it. Creating additional injured people doesn't help. It's the same logic as not reaching into a dog fight. 

Note: I don't use this exact framework much anymore myself. It's a really great way to get started, though. Once you get a feel for the goals of this kind of thing and some practice, you'll develop your own style.

# Requirements 

Not taking the escalation personally, Listening to the literal words the escalated person is saying. 

# Important Concepts

* Acknowledgement - a tailored version of a canned response that helps the escalated person feel heard.

* Stakes - What the escalated person feels is 'on the line.' 

* Face - the public image people want to present within a given social framework

# Getting Started

## Stay Calm 

Whatever is happening isn't about you. But if you inappropriately meet them where they are at, you can become the focus of the escalated behavior. 

    **Tips to stay calm**
    * Remember that whatever caused this behavior is probably one of many things happening in the person's life. The current moment/issue probably isn't all that important to them. 

    * Remember that at the end of this you get to go do something else. You'll go home and forget this conversation soon enough. 

    * If you are the sort who likes a challenge, take it as a challenge to resolve the situation. I usually have a goal of getting the escalated person to apologize on their own, laugh at something I said, or thank me. I can usually accomplish one of these things.  I've gotten people to apologize, unprompted, for threatening to kill me. 

    * Be honest about outcomes. If you know early on that you cannot resolve the situation to the person's satisfaction... tell them that. This keeps expectations reasonable. 'I hear what you're saying. I don't think we can do exactly what you'd like but we can do our best.' 

## Redirect

Sometimes it easier if the escalated situation is artifically directed at you. Getting in between two people can be difficult. If one person is relatively calm and the other is not. You can focus on how you failed the situation to bring the heat onto yourself, which you can then defuse much easier. 

## Body Language 

Your goal is to be non-threatening. If you can make yourself as neutral as furniture, it's going to make life easier. 

Don't face them directly when they're tense. Stand at a slight angle to them with a neutral posture. I usually stand with my left shoulder closer to them than my right. I've found this disarms people because most people are right handed so I'm putting my 'weak' side close to their 'strong' side. Alternatively, put a table or something else between you. Nothing so tall that they can't see your hands. 

Once you've connected with them, you can turn to face them more directly if that's more comfortable for you.

Eye contact is very useful. It makes people feel more vulnerable and can make them feel seen.

## Acknowledgements

Acknowledgements are a formula-based phrase that escalated people tend to respond to. It has four goals:

   * Demonstrate that you are listening 

   * Display your understanding of the cause of the conflict.

   * Create a goal-based conversation 

   * Bring you and the escalated person into the same team. 

A simple acknowledgement might look like:

```I understand you're (emotion) about (problem more-or-less exactly as they stated it). I would be (emotion) in your shoes. Let's (solution-based phrase that includes you and the other person on the same team). (optional question to move the discussion forward or to take the suggested action.)```

So if someone is upset about being cut in line, and the line is moving quickly you might use:

```Hey. I get it. You're upset that people are cutting in line. I know I feel disrespected when I'm following the rules and others aren't. Let's go through the line together so you can get your things and we can talk about how we might do this better next time. Is that okay?```

Even if you just try to remember the ones about being angry, they can be useful to drill down into the issue.

Note that your statements about how you might feel in their shoes don't have to be true. Lying is an option. That step is used to change the conversation from a 'me versus you' to a 'us together' one. Anger that a person can't direct tends to fizzle out.

## Set Boundaries 

If you're going to lay down some rules, the time to do it is right after you get yourselves on the same side. They should be presented as expectations that apply to both of you (all parties) and not rules the other person should follow. 

## Manage Perception

If the conflict you're walking into is between someone you know and someone you don't, be cognizant that the person you don't know will perceive a bias. A quick way to work around this is to tell the person you know to shut up and let the person you don't know explain their side first. You're going to have to trust you can explain your reasoning later to the person you already know. Giving the appearance you're taking their side can make them want to work with you and forget the other person. 

Another aspect of managing perception is knowing how you look to other people. I'm short. I do not generally come across as threatening. Tall and masculine people are going to come across as more threatening. Sitting down or leaning on something, if possible, can help break that up. The person can't listen effectively if they're both escalated and looking for threatening behavior. Doing something with your hands can also help. Even if it's kinda pointless busy work. Some threats may not be obvious to you, but are obvious to others. (White women have historically been a threat to black men, as an example. A white woman threatening to call the police on a black man is a threat of violence because of the history involved with that dynamic.)
